# Frogz and Gobz
This repository contains the code for a 2D game that I created using Unity and C#.
One good file to look at is my [game design document](https://github.com/nlozben/frogz_and_gobz/blob/main/Assets/Documentation/S22_GDD_2D_Lozben_Nicholas.docx)
because this explains what the game is all about and the process that went into making it.
Another good file to look at is my [random world generation C# script](https://github.com/nlozben/frogz_and_gobz/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/WorldGenerator.cs)
because this showcases some of my programming skills.
